# tech-jobs-clustering
Unsupervised learning approach to data analyst job listings. 
A dataset consisting of roughly 2,000 data analyst jobs was cleaned, explored, and analyzed with the intent of using unsupervised algorithms such as clustering to find trends and associations in the dataset. 

The Jupyter notebook thoroughly documents the processes as they are performed.
